                <h3>Earthquake Alert</h3>
                <p>A magnitude 5.0 earthquake has been reported in the region. Take necessary precautions.</p>
                <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/earthquakes?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwrIixBhBbEiwACEqDJXrcH2TTcuGFvfnu8wF7JzQKIo4fRLD9LZw-JEqzP0la1tr6F7VPiRoCLBUQAvD_BwE" class="details-link">More details</a>

                    <p>Worldwide, more than one million earthquakes occur each year, or an average of two a minute. A major earthquake in an urban area is one of the worst natural disasters that can occur. During the last four decades (1970-2017), earthquakes have been responsible for over a million deaths around the world in Armenia, China, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Iran, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, and Turkey.</p>

                <h3>Tsunami Alert</h3>
                <p>A tsunami warning has been issued for coastal areas. Evacuate immediately to higher ground.</p>

                <div class="details" style="display: none;">
                    <p>A tsunami is a series of extremely long waves caused by a large and sudden displacement of the ocean, usually the result of an earthquake below or near the ocean floor. This force creates waves that radiate outward in all directions away from their source, sometimes crossing entire ocean basins.</p>

                    <p>An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.</p>

                <h3>Windstorm Alert</h3>
                <p>A windstorm with gusts up to 70 mph is expected. Stay indoors and away from windows.</p>

                    <p>Windstorm, a wind that is strong enough to cause at least light damage to trees and buildings and may or may not be accompanied by precipitation. Wind speeds during a windstorm typically exceed 55 km (34 miles) per hour. Wind damage can be attributed to gusts (short bursts of high-speed winds) or longer periods of stronger sustained winds. Although tornadoes and tropical cyclones also produce wind damage, they are usually classified separately.</p>

                    <p>Today the World Food Programme has released a tool that collects reliable information into a concise dashboard â€” immediately giving humanitarian organizations the information they need to help people affected by a tropical storm. This service is available free to the entire humanitarian community.

                    WFP's Automated Disaster Analysis and Mapping system, or ADAM, has been active for earthquake alerts since 2015. Now the tool has been expanded to monitor tropical storms, another phenomenon which often generates humanitarian crises in developing countries.</p>
